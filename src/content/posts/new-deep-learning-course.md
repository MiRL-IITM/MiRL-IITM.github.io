We are thrilled to announce the launch of our new graduate course, **DA6402: Deep Learning for Medical Imaging**, offered by the Department of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.

## Course Overview

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to deep learning techniques specifically tailored for medical imaging applications. Students will learn how to design, train, and evaluate neural networks for various tasks, including:

- Image reconstruction (MRI, CT)
- Segmentation and classification
- Registration and motion correction
- Generative models for medical data

## Who Should Attend?

The course is designed for graduate students (Masters and Ph.D.) with a background in:

- Linear algebra and probability
- Basic signal processing
- Python programming (PyTorch/TensorFlow experience is a plus)

## Syllabus Highlights

1.  **Foundations**: Neural network architectures (CNNs, Transformers, UNet).
2.  **Reconstruction**: Physics-guided deep learning.
3.  **Analysis**: Uncertainty estimation and interpretability.
4.  **Projects**: Hands-on term projects working with real clinical datasets.

## Registration

Registration opens on **August 15, 2024**. For more details, visit the [Courses](/courses) page or contact the instructor.

We look forward to seeing you in class!
