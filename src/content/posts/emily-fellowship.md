We are proud to announce that Ph.D. student Emily Zhang has been awarded the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) award!

## About the Fellowship

The NSF GRFP is one of the most prestigious awards for graduate students in STEM fields, providing three years of funding to support outstanding research.

## Emily's Research

Emily's research focuses on applying diffusion models to medical image reconstruction. Her work has shown that diffusion models can:

- Generate high-quality MRI reconstructions from highly undersampled data
- Provide uncertainty estimates that are clinically valuable
- Generalize across different imaging protocols

## Congratulations

Please join us in congratulating Emily on this well-deserved recognition of her excellent research!
