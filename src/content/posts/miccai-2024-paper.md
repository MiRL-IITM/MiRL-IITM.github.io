We are excited to announce that our paper "Motion-Compensated Cardiac MRI Using Implicit Neural Representations" has been accepted at MICCAI 2024!

## Paper Highlights

The paper, led by Ph.D. student David Kim, introduces a novel approach to cardiac MRI reconstruction that:

- Uses implicit neural representations to model continuous cardiac motion
- Eliminates the need for breath-holds during acquisition
- Achieves high-quality images even in patients with irregular heartbeats

## Best Paper Nomination

We are honored that the paper has been nominated as a Best Paper finalist. The final results will be announced at the conference in October.

## What's Next

David will present the work at MICCAI 2024 in Marrakech, Morocco. We're also working on clinical validation studies with our hospital partners.

Congratulations to the entire team!
