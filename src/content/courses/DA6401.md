## Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to Deep Learning. Beginning with the history of neural networks and the fundamental Perceptron, we move to modern Feedforward Neural Networks, training methodologies, and optimization techniques. The course covers specialized architectures including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for computer vision, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence modeling, and Transformers for natural language processing. We conclude with advanced generative models such as GANs and Diffusion models.
