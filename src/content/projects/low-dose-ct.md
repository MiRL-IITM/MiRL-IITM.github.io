## Overview

CT imaging delivers essential diagnostic information but involves ionizing radiation. This project develops methods to achieve diagnostic quality images at significantly reduced radiation doses.

## Approach

We combine physics-based iterative reconstruction with deep learning to:
- Denoise low-dose acquisitions
- Incorporate anatomical priors
- Preserve diagnostic features

## Clinical Translation

Working with clinical partners to validate our methods across multiple CT applications including chest, abdomen, and cardiac imaging.
