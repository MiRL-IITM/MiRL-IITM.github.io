## Overview

Cardiac MRI is challenging due to cardiac and respiratory motion. Traditional approaches require breath-holds and ECG gating, which can be difficult for sick patients.

## Innovation

We develop motion-robust reconstruction methods using:
- Implicit neural representations for continuous motion modeling
- Self-gated acquisition strategies
- Real-time reconstruction algorithms

## Goals

Enable free-breathing cardiac MRI with diagnostic quality for all patients, including those who cannot hold their breath.
