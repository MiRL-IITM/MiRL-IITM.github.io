## Biography

I completed my B.Tech in Mechatronics Engineering from SASTRA University, Thanjavur, where I developed a solid interdisciplinary foundation across mechanical systems, electronics, control engineering, and intelligent algorithms. As part of my undergraduate capstone project, I designed a voice-controlled bionic arm using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) integrated with a NodeMCU ESP8266, which sparked my long-term interest in robotics, embedded intelligence, and human–machine interaction.

Following my undergraduate studies, I worked for two years as a Data Analyst at Incedo Technology Solutions, where I was involved in building and optimizing data-driven solutions and analytics pipelines for real-world applications. This industrial experience strengthened my expertise in machine learning, data engineering, and scalable AI systems, and reinforced my motivation to pursue research that connects theoretical AI models with practical deployment.

I subsequently qualified the GATE examination and am currently pursuing an M.S. by Research at IIT Madras. My primary research interests include artificial intelligence, computer vision, NLP and Reinforced Learning, with a focus on vision-based perception, multimodal learning, intelligent decision-making, and AI-driven physical systems. I am particularly interested in developing robust, real-world AI systems that operate at the intersection of data, perception, and control.

Among my notable achievements, I was a member of the winning team of the Amazon Machine Learning Challenge 2025–26, securing the title for the year.
