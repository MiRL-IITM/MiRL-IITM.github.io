I am a Master’s student with interests in machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and medical imaging.
My academic focus is on building a strong theoretical and practical foundation in machine learning, deep learning,
and reinforcement learning, with the goal of applying these techniques to solve real-world problems in the medical
domain, including medical image analysis and clinical decision support.
