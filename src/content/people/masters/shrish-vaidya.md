I am an MS by Research student in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, with a strong foundation in electronics and computer vision. My research interests lie at the intersection of agentic AI, medical image analysis, and multimodal learning, with a particular focus on building reliable, protocol-driven AI systems for clinical applications. I am a co-author of multiple peer-reviewed publications, including MedPAO: A Protocol-Driven Agent for Structuring Medical Reports, accepted at MICCAI 2025, which proposes a verifiable agent-based framework for medical report structuring. Previously, I have gained industry and research experience through internships at Airbus, Samsung PRISM, and IIT Guwahati, working on efficient vision models, image restoration, and incremental learning. I have also served as a teaching assistant for several AI and medical imaging courses at IIT Madras and qualified GATE 2024 with a score of 656.
