I am a Master's student in Engineering Design at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, specializing in Computer Vision and Medical Image Analysis. My research focuses on designing interpretable, multi-domain AI systems for medical applications, including super-resolution and agentic workflows for clinical report automation. I am a co-author of peer-reviewed publications such as "MDFN: Efficient Image Super-Resolution through Multi-Domain Feature Fusion" (ICVGIP 2025) and "MedPAO: A Protocol-Driven Agent for Structuring Medical Reports" (MICCAI 2025). Prior to joining IIT Madras, I worked as an Assistant Application Developer in Medical Devices Manufacturing Company, leading full-stack development of IoT medical platforms and embedded firmware for critical care ventilators. I also served as a Teaching Assistant for graduate courses in Machine Learning and Medical Image Analysis at IIT Madras and received the Best Innovation in Healthcare award at the Pravega Innovation Summit, IISc Bangalore.
